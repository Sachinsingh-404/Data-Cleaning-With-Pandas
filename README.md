# Cricket Data Cleaning with Pandas

## Overview
This project cleans and preprocesses a raw cricket dataset using Python's Pandas library. The aim is to ensure data accuracy and reliability, establishing a robust foundation for analyzing match statistics and player performance.

## Objectives
- **Data Cleaning:** Remove duplicate entries, address missing values, and standardize formats to enhance data quality.
- **Data Structuring:** Transform the raw dataset into a structured format for accurate analysis.
- **Outcome:** Deliver a reliable dataset that enables precise analysis of cricket performance metrics.

## Methodology
1. **Data Extraction:** Imported the raw cricket dataset.
2. **Cleaning Process:** 
   - Removed duplicates and irrelevant data.
   - Filled or removed missing values.
   - Standardized data formats for consistency.
3. **Data Structuring:** Organized the cleaned data into a well-structured format suitable for further analysis.
4. **Result:** Produced a high-quality dataset that can be used for in-depth analysis of cricket matches and player statistics.
